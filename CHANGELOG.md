## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-27

Stable promotion of `1.4.0-rc.1`, covering the 81 commits since
`ironclaw-v1.3.0` and the complete release-candidate scope below.

### Added

- Durable notification inbox: runs publish authoritative outcomes and
  actionable gates to a per-user inbox, surfaced by the WebUI notification
  center, so approvals and auth prompts survive a missed session.
- Background subagents: a parent turn can spawn children that run and deliver
  on their own, with per-child delivery, activation provenance, a derived cap
  on autonomous wakes, and healing sweeps for orphaned children.
- Persistent per-user sandbox containers on the local-Docker profile, reached
  over Docker Exec so container-local installs and state survive between
  commands. The Railway preview profile still runs an ephemeral worker per
  command and keeps only its checkpointed workspace.
- Managed per-user sandbox egress proxy, with manifest-declared direct-exec
  credential bindings that stay behind it so secrets are never handed to
  sandboxed code.
- Run-now for automations, plus exact run capability facts.
- Durable backend suggestions generated over the user's own no-approval,
  read-only tools and gated on connected extensions.
- Google Docs semantic editing tools; run timing evidence in downloadable
  conversation artifacts.
- Opt-in in-worker SSH in the runtime image (see Operators below).

### Fixed

- Structured finalization stalls are bounded, and OpenAI-compatible
  reasoning-only responses are preserved.
- Provider failures and auth diagnostics reach the model as readable context
  instead of opaque errors.
- libSQL write-lane starvation no longer cascades through the resource
  governor as unrelated tool failures.
- Telegram separates workspace-bot pairing from personal device linking, and
  keeps paired channels ready while collapsing streaming reply drafts.
- Slack delivers the unlinked-user connect nudge privately with a one-click
  connect link.
- Installation state written by 1.2.x is accepted and preserved, so a
  deployment that skipped 1.3 upgrades directly.
- Incremental compaction summary context is preserved.

### Operators

- The runtime image can start an in-worker SSH listener. It is **off unless**
  `IRONCLAW_REBORN_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` is set to an OpenSSH *public* key, which
  enables public-key-only login as user `agent` on container port 2222; that
  port must be published to be reachable. `agent` shares uid 1000 with the
  `ironclaw` runtime user, so an SSH session holds the full runtime identity --
  treat the private key like shell access to the service.
- `IRONCLAW_REBORN_WORKSPACE_ROOT` is honored on both CLI boot paths. Neither
  it nor `IRONCLAW_REBORN_HOME` may be set to the filesystem root.
- New sandbox knobs: `IRONCLAW_REBORN_SANDBOX_PROXY_IMAGE` and
  `IRONCLAW_SANDBOX_EXTRA_ALLOWED_DOMAINS`.

### Upgrading

No migration steps from 1.3.0.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-19

Stable promotion of `1.3.0-rc.2`, including the upgrade and container fixes
validated in RC2 and the complete RC1 scope below.

### Fixed in 1.3.0-rc.2

- Upgrades from 1.2 now accept and preserve the released extension
  `activation_state` field instead of crash-looping during startup.
- The canonical Reborn runtime image again supports opt-in, public-key-only
  worker SSH on port 2222 while running IronClaw as an unprivileged user.

### Added

- **Per-user model preferences.** Each user picks their own model from WebUI
  settings, the CLI, or chat commands, and the choice follows them through
  channel turns and inbound replay. Admins bound what is selectable with a
  tenant-scoped model selection policy.
- **Structured automations.** A scheduled trigger now carries a validated
  execution contract — prompt spec, execution policy, required skills — checked
  by a fail-closed preflight at creation instead of a free-form prompt string,
  and unattended runs get their own protocol. A deterministic no-result
  sentinel lets a run that has nothing to report finish silently instead of
  delivering filler.
- **Document editing.** Structural edits to `.docx`, `.xlsx`, and `.pptx`
  files, and PDF rendering from HTML.
- **Telegram linked devices.** Pair a personal Telegram account with the bot
  channel so the agent can read your conversations and act as you through the
  standard messaging operations. Reads are live against Telegram's own servers
  — there is no local mirror, retention policy, or search index of the account
  — while message content a run actually reads is retained in that run's
  transcript like any other tool result.
- **The full Slack messaging vocabulary.** Eight more standard operations —
  edit message, delete message, add reaction, remove reaction, open DM, get
  message, resolve user, list members — complete the core surface.
- **Ranked memory recall.** Retrieval ranks by relevance instead of requiring
  every term of the question to appear in the saved fact, so a differently
  worded question still finds it, and broken memory is visibly different from
  empty memory. Memory-save guidance ships with an always-on `MEMORY.md` prompt
  lane.
- **Opt-in parallel tool batches** in the agent loop.
- Explicit Anthropic `cache_control` prompt-cache breakpoints on both
  transports.
- A shared WebUI search field, and per-field help text on admin extension
  configuration forms alongside a rewritten channel setup guide.

### Changed

- **Substantially fewer database writes per turn.** Capability invocation state
  persists at gate and terminal edges only; runtime milestone events, thread
  index touches, message lookup indexes, trigger and outbound state, and
  process heartbeats all coalesce or fold into existing rows.
- Turn execution runs on prepared-context ("unbound") turns behind one accept
  door, replacing the kernel binding-ref path.
- Channel ingress is normalized once, with reply split from delivery.
- The public documentation site deploys from a `docs-live` branch that stable
  releases move, so published docs describe the released binary rather than
  unreleased `main`.

### Fixed

- Context-window eviction compacts instead of discarding: the accepted task and
  any steering survive the eviction.
- Lease expiry recovers safe runs instead of failing them, and the journal
  heartbeat pool is isolated.
- An unavailable capability call is repaired instead of aborting the run, and
  repeated-call detection is advisory rather than fatal.
- Model-bound secrets are redacted without rejecting the turn.
- Telegram sticker and voice attachments no longer brick the channel, and the
  2FA gate on migrated data centers is recognized and says where the login code
  arrives.
- Extension cards and install results report what actually happened; bundled
  MCP state refreshes after auth; hosted MCP OAuth supports origin-scoped
  servers.
- WebUI: SSE reconnect storms are bounded, long conversation titles reveal on
  hover, exposed-route copy is localized, and a failed tool call reads as a
  subtle badge instead of a loud summary.
- The resource governor keeps retrying through a full libSQL writer attempt
  instead of surfacing the contention as a failure, and libSQL write-lane
  starvation no longer cascades through it: the delta journal gets its own
  bounded write lane, congestion is distinguished from storage damage so a
  contended write replays instead of invalidating the authority, and stale
  reservations are swept rather than leaking as permanent `Active` holds.

### Removed

- Retired WebUI surfaces: the standalone missions page, the routines surface,
  admin analytics placeholders, and project mission placeholders.
- Retired IronLoop network settings.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-13

Stable promotion of `1.2.0-rc.3`, including the fixes validated in RC2 and
RC3 and the complete RC1 feature set below.

### Fixed in 1.2.0-rc.3

- The runtime container image now installs `curl`, so in-container HTTP
  healthchecks can execute. Orchestrators probe the worker with
  `curl -fsS http://localhost:3000/`; the image shipped no HTTP client, so the
  probe could never run, the container was never marked healthy, and the deploy
  timed out into `error` while the listener served 200s throughout.

### Fixed in 1.2.0-rc.2

- Windows first-start filesystem publication now uses native atomic rename
  semantics instead of hard links and tolerates unsupported directory syncs.
- Release smoke runs preserve the Windows account identity required to secure
  the standalone secrets key, isolate workspace state, and keep `icacls`
  status output from contaminating machine-readable CLI JSON.

### Added

- **Slack channel context.** Pinging the bot at the top level of a channel
  gives the run recent channel history as context (last 30 messages); pinging
  inside a thread gives it that whole thread (up to 100 replies). Context is
  fetched host-side with the bot token (`channels:history` scope; missing
  scopes degrade to no context), and is framed to the model as untrusted
  quoted channel content, never as instructions. Telegram has no equivalent —
  the Bot API cannot read history — so Telegram context is the conversation
  the bot has itself processed.
- `can_reply_in_threads` channel presentation flag declaring each channel's
  reply placement: Slack (`true`) replies in a thread rooted on the pinged
  message; Telegram (`false`) replies as an anchored quote of it.

### Changed

- **Add the bot to a channel and it just works.** Shared-conversation
  admission is presence-based: any Slack channel or Telegram group the bot
  has been added to is served, with no allowlist and nothing to configure
  (the `slack_allowed_channels` / `telegram_allowed_channels` settings are
  gone). Channels whose actor identity is not per-user still never serve
  shared conversations.
- **Shared conversations are genuinely shared — and every run still acts as
  its invoker.** A Slack thread (each top-level ping roots its own) or a
  Telegram group/topic is ONE continuous conversation that every paired
  participant shares: anyone can follow up on what someone else started.
  Each message still runs as the person who sent it — their identity,
  memory, settings, and approval gates — never as a configured subject or
  the operator (that mechanism is retired). Pre-existing shared threads
  simply resume. Shared channels are no longer offered as per-user
  notification delivery targets (DM targets are unchanged), and previously
  stored shared-channel notification preferences fail closed at resolution.
- **Unpaired users get pointed the right way, in place.** An unpaired user
  who pings the bot in a shared conversation gets the connect notice as a
  reply anchored on their own message (threaded in Slack, quoted in
  Telegram), throttled per conversation — instead of silence or running as
  someone else. DMs keep their existing connect prompt.
- **Every parked gate is announced, on both delivery lanes.** Gate prompts are
  keyed by their gate ref in the live conversation lane and the background
  automation lane alike, so a run that parks on several approval/auth gates
  announces each one instead of collapsing into the first prompt's delivery
  identity. One deploy-boundary note: a gate prompt delivered but not yet
  acknowledged when this version deploys re-announces once (its durable
  delivery identity changed shape).

### Removed

- All shared-channel admin-configuration fields: the `slack_shared_subject_user_id`
  and `slack_subject_routes` subject fields AND the `slack_allowed_channels` /
  `telegram_allowed_channels` allowlists. Shared-channel admission is now
  presence-based — there is nothing to configure, and adding the bot to a
  channel is what admits it (see "Changed" above). Saved values for any of
  these retired handles are inert, and new saves fail closed as unknown fields.

## [1.1.0-rc.1] - 2026-08-03

First release candidate since 1.0.0. The headline work is extension reach —
registering arbitrary hosted MCP servers, installing from IronHub deep links,
durable file attachments that cross channels, and Slack `/ironclaw` slash
commands — plus a broad pass on making failures legible: to the model, which
now gets told what to do next instead of an opaque stop, and to the user, who
gets localized, actionable errors instead of silent dead ends.

**Upgrading from 1.0.0.** No migration steps. Extension lifecycle state moved
to a normalized on-disk shape; rows written by 1.0.0 keep deserializing. The
one behavioral removal is the `/webhooks/slack/events` compatibility alias
(see Removed).

### Added

- **Custom MCP servers.** Register a hosted MCP server from the WebUI and use
  its tools like any other extension: discovery accepts bounded
  OpenAPI-derived tool catalogs within the manifest's declared tool budget,
  auth is resolved during registration, and the registered tools are exposed
  to the model.
- **IronHub install flow.** Install extensions from an IronHub deep link,
  including private manifest sources, through a register/install gateway.
- **Attachments.** Durable cross-channel file flows: a file sent on one
  channel stays retrievable from the others and from the WebUI.
- **Slack slash commands.** Native `/ironclaw` commands in Slack, backed by a
  role-filtered command palette in the WebUI and role gating on admin command
  actions.
- **Memory as an extension.** The memory provider is modeled as a userland
  extension with a host-managed lifecycle and a contract built around declared
  capabilities, so a provider advertises what it can actually do instead of
  being assumed uniform.
- **Sandbox lane (opt-in, partly unwired).** A `RuntimeKind::Sandbox` runtime
  lane with credential reuse, leaf-scoped mount containment, per-user sandbox
  identity primitives, and a credential placeholder registry. Docker-connect
  retry, the egress allowlist, and shell limits ship unwired in this release.
- **Trigger poller on production-shaped runtimes** (opt-in), and the SSO/admin
  identity resolver wired into those runtimes.
- **QA run artifacts.** Caller-scoped run and full-thread artifact export,
  gated off by default, plus a regression promotion loop for the test suite.
- **`BENCHMARKING_MODE`.** An opt-in system-prompt addendum for unattended
  evaluation runs.

### Changed

- **Extension persistence:** normalize filesystem-backed extension lifecycle
  state into typed installation (with the embedded, hash-pinned manifest
  definition), user-membership, and credential-binding records with bounded
  CAS updates, a CAS-protected mutation lease for membership and removal
  transitions, `removed_at` soft-removal tombstones, legacy aggregate
  compatibility views, and restart repair. Retires the per-installation
  diagnostic health snapshot: it was always `healthy`, never read, and never
  surfaced, while the host's activation record already owns extension failure
  state. Rows written by the previous release keep deserializing.
- **Model failures now carry a next step.** Every termination path — no
  progress, iteration limit, disabled capability, denied call, provider error
  — tells the model what would unlock the call instead of stopping opaquely.
- **WebUI performance:** route-level code splitting, deferred Markdown and
  syntax highlighting during chat streaming, optimized embedded static-asset
  delivery, and pagination for the sidebar thread list, admin users list, and
  older logs.
- **Shared WebUI controls:** a common settings `Switch`, a shared
  `ConfirmDialog` replacing native browser confirmations, and normalized
  control typography.

### Fixed

- **libSQL prefix queries scanned the whole table:** record reads, subtree
  deletes, and FTS backfill matched descendants with `path LIKE ? ESCAPE '!'`,
  which cannot use the primary key, so every one of them scanned all of
  `root_filesystem_entries`. Their cost therefore grew with the total size of
  the database — threads, turns, memory, events — rather than with what the
  caller asked for. They now use the same `path >= ? AND path < ?` bounds the
  Postgres backend and libSQL's own `list_dir` already used, so each seeks the
  path index. Measured end-to-end on a 200k-row database:
  `/api/webchat/v2/extensions` 260ms -> 28ms and `.../extensions/registry`
  380ms -> 20ms. This is what made the hosted Extensions page take seconds and
  left removed extensions on screen until a manual refresh: the page's
  post-removal refetch was aborted before the server answered.

- **Extension list issued a query per installation:** normalizing the
  aggregate into child rows made `list_installations` read each installation's
  membership and credential-binding rows separately, costing `1 + 2N` round
  trips. Both child collections are now read once and joined in memory (`3`
  queries regardless of installation count).

- **Agent-loop termination recovery:** tell the model when no-progress or the
  iteration limit would otherwise stop a run, preserve that one-shot warning
  across checkpoints, and allow one normal capability-enabled recovery turn
  before taking the existing typed failure path.
- **Recoverable capability errors:** carry the complete producer-scrubbed cause
  through the bounded model diagnostic channel, including path-shaped context,
  and emit an explicit fallback when a runtime supplies no usable detail.
- **Skill selection:** instruct the model to review visible skills before
  answering and clarify that `skill_activate` loads full instructions for
  relevant skills selected by exact listed name.
- **Model recovery:** preserve typed, sanitized context-overflow,
  content-filter, and invalid-output recovery controls across checkpoints so a
  restarted turn can still ask the model to recover without exposing provider
  diagnostics or granting an unbounded retry budget.
- **Generic channel pairing:** accept command-wrapped proof codes only through
  bounded manifest-declared prefixes; Telegram now declares `/start`, while
  undeclared commands remain ordinary inbound messages.
- **Extension OAuth authorization:** resolve provider, account label, and
  scopes from the installed extension's manifest requirement instead of
  accepting browser-selected credential authority; after OAuth, retry only
  internal caller-scoped readiness until the extension is active, without a
  second provider exchange or public activation step.
- **Hosted MCP discovery:** accept bounded OpenAPI-derived tool catalogs within
  the manifest's declared tool budget, reject malformed catalogs atomically,
  and never publish bundled static declarations as a fallback for failed live
  discovery.
- **Channel delivery:** consume durable turn-lifecycle events through the
  generic, source-route-revalidating coordinator so OAuth-delayed final replies
  return to Slack, Telegram, and future channels without a polling watcher.
- **Automation delivery:** honor each trigger's creator-selected outbound
  target at fire time instead of silently falling back to the user-wide
  default.
- **Telegram automation delivery:** expose paired Telegram DMs through the
  generic outbound-target registry so creator-selected routine results resolve
  and deliver through the shipping Telegram channel.
- **Channel removal:** revoke caller-owned OAuth or proof-code pairing state
  through the shared lifecycle before deleting any channel installation, so
  removing Telegram, Slack, or a future channel unpairs it on every surface.
- **One authorization per vendor account:** authorizing a vendor now covers
  every installed extension sharing that account, instead of re-prompting per
  extension. Token response scopes are trusted over the OAuth redirect echo.
- **Extension package roots** are persisted rather than fabricated on load, so
  a stale or partial catalog entry no longer takes down startup.
- **Tool disclosure** is narrowed by the caller's allow-set, closing three
  paths that leaked tool definitions the caller was not granted.
- **Provider errors are classified correctly:** rate limits are no longer read
  as auth failures, a missing model is not retried, adapters report the
  provider's real finish reason, and the runner stops silently retrying
  model-stage failures that cannot succeed.
- **Context overflow and compaction:** secret matches are redacted during
  compaction and a run recovers from context overflow instead of terminating.
- **libSQL durability:** writers are serialized, cancelled transactions and
  interrupted history migrations recover, and transient writer contention no
  longer surfaces as a failed run.
- **Panic and cancellation safety** on the run path, plus bounded
  deterministic gateway failures so a wedged model stage cannot hang a turn.
- **WebUI streaming and navigation:** smooth streaming with preserved model
  phases, route state and workspace-tree state preserved across SPA
  navigation, viewport preserved while loading older messages, message actions
  kept visible, and active run state preserved when cancellation fails.
- **WebUI correctness and a11y:** localized chat/extension/OAuth failure
  messages, surfaced admin user-management failures, recovery from transient
  session checks, focus trapping in the extension configuration modal, no
  crash on admin configuration paste, pairing prompts rendered without a text
  input, tool-permission selection retained while saving, always-allow reset
  when the approval gate changes, and authenticated previews for workspace
  file links.
- **Automations** inherit the implicit source channel target, and the
  outbound delivery-target registry is caller-scoped structurally rather than
  by convention.
- **Skills:** the model is told to review the available skills before
  answering.
- **`ironclaw service`:** the generated systemd unit no longer quotes
  `WorkingDirectory=`.
- **Projects** show only API-backed data instead of placeholder rows.

### Performance

- **Hosted Postgres API capacity** regressed by the row-native process journal
  is recovered.
- **Durable turn-event reads** are served by an indexed scope+cursor query
  instead of a scan.

### Removed

- **Slack compatibility route:** retire the one-release
  `/webhooks/slack/events` forwarding alias. Slack Event Subscriptions must use
  `/webhooks/extensions/slack/events`; generic product-auth OAuth callbacks are
  unchanged.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-27

First stable release of a rearchitected IronClaw. This is not an increment on
the 0.29.x line — it is a ground-up rebuild of the agent runtime, storage,
extension host, and web UI.

**The `ironclaw` binary is the rearchitected CLI.** The v1 monolith builds as
the `ironclaw-legacy` binary and is not published; 1.0.0 publishes the new
`ironclaw` binary only.

### This is not an in-place upgrade from 0.29.x

There is no migration for v1 config, databases, settings, or secrets, and
installing 1.0.0 does not touch your existing v1 data. Treat it as a fresh
install: point `IRONCLAW_REBORN_HOME` at a new directory, run
`ironclaw onboard`, and reconnect your providers and channels. Do not point it
at a v1 data directory.

### What ships

- **Platforms.** Seven targets — macOS (Apple Silicon, Intel), Linux
  (`x86_64`/`aarch64`, gnu and static musl), and Windows (`x86_64`), with shell,
  PowerShell, and MSI installers.
- **Guided setup.** `ironclaw onboard` provisions the config, the encrypted
  credential store, an LLM provider (interactive key entry with a live probe),
  a WebUI login token, and — on macOS and Linux — the background service. The
  credential store's master key is provisioned in the OS keychain when one is
  available, falling back to a locally cached key file otherwise.
- **Model providers.** 26 providers in the built-in catalog, including NEAR AI,
  OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, Ollama, OpenRouter, Groq, DeepSeek, and
  any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Manage routes with `ironclaw models`.
- **Web UI.** `ironclaw serve` starts the WebChat v2 interface with the frontend
  embedded in the binary — no separate asset deploy. Chat, extensions,
  automations, settings, and admin surfaces are served from root-level routes.
- **Extensions.** Twelve first-party extensions ship embedded and install
  without a network fetch: GitHub, Gmail, Google Calendar, Docs, Drive, Sheets,
  Slides, Notion, NEAR AI MCP, Slack, Telegram, and web access. Manage them with
  `ironclaw extension` or the WebUI registry.
- **Channels.** Slack and Telegram, both configured from the WebUI; Slack
  connects per user through OAuth, Telegram through a per-user pairing code.
- **Runtime.** Skills, scheduled and triggered automations, subagents, workspace
  memory, and trace capture.
- **Storage.** File-backed libSQL by default, so a stock install needs no
  external database; PostgreSQL is opt-in via `[storage]`.
- **Service management.** `ironclaw service install|start|stop|restart|status|uninstall`
  runs the binary as a launchd user agent (macOS) or systemd user unit (Linux).

### Known limitations

- `ironclaw channels list`, `hooks list`, and `logs` appear in `--help` but
  return an explicit "not implemented yet" error.
- `mcp`, `memory`, `pairing`, `import`, and `login` subcommands from v1 have no
  equivalent in this release; MCP servers and memory are reached through
  extensions and the WebUI instead.
- `onboard --import-history` parses but does nothing.
- `skills` is list-only from the CLI.
- `extension` and `skills` work out of the box: `ironclaw onboard` defaults to
  the `local-dev` profile, where both are fully supported (as under
  `local-dev-yolo`, `hosted-single-tenant`, and `hosted-single-tenant-volume`).
  Only operators who explicitly choose `production` or `migration-dry-run`
  hit a clear error instead.

Please report problems at https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/issues — include
`ironclaw status --json` output.

The itemized changes since 1.0.0-rc.1 follow; see the 1.0.0-rc.1 entry below for
everything that landed between 0.29.1 and the release candidate.

### Fixed

- *(webui)* restore SSE streams across navigation, so chat keeps streaming when
  the user moves between WebUI routes mid-turn ([#6425](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/6425)).
- *(webui)* stop the WebChat "Disconnected" lockout caused by rate-limit budget
  exhaustion and navigation-race SSE thrash ([#6592](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/6592)).

### CI / Release

- *(release)* update the Reborn Dockerfile and make the Reborn Docker image
  buildable ([#6612](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/6612)).
- *(ci)* run the full Reborn test and E2E gates on `release-fix-*` pull-request
  branches ([#6537](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/6537)).

  hit a clear error instead.

Please report problems at https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/issues — include
`ironclaw status --json` output.

The itemized changes since 0.29.1 follow.

### Added

- *(reborn)* automations and `trigger_list` now surface why a scheduled trigger is currently held (approval/auth/in-progress) and how many scheduled occurrences elapsed while held ([#5886](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/issues/5886)).
- *(reborn)* `ironclaw service install`/`start`/`stop`/`restart`/`status`/`uninstall` manage the standalone Reborn binary as an OS-native service (launchd user agent on macOS, systemd user unit on Linux), with a webui-token-file fallback for `serve` and atomic install with rollback on failure.

### Fixed

- *(reborn)* OAuth setup flows survive service restarts and replica hand-offs: the setup-lane PKCE verifier is stored durably per flow (secret store, flow-scoped TTL) instead of only process-locally, terminal callback outcomes discard it, and lifecycle cleanup drops verifiers for canceled flows eagerly.
- *(reborn)* `ironclaw serve` rejects populated legacy `[slack]` setup fields at startup with a pointer to the WebUI extensions page instead of silently ignoring them (`[slack].enabled` alone stays tolerated).
- *(reborn)* route Rig-backed model calls through provider streaming for WebUI v2 runs, cover delayed/broken/cancelled/transient mock LLM behavior in served E2E tests, and verify failed runs can retry after a transient checkpoint-state outage, including failures before the first checkpoint.
- *(reborn)* activating an extension whose OAuth provider was never configured on the instance now fails immediately with the exact `ironclaw config set` commands and restart step, instead of parking an unresolvable auth gate ([#6335](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/issues/6335)).
- *(reborn)* host-authored remediation text reaches the model intact again instead of degrading to "capability summary unavailable" ([#6335](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/issues/6335)).
- *(webui-v2)* report settings imports with no supported entries as failures instead of showing a false success message ([#6179](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/issues/6179)).
- *(filesystem)* make libSQL descendant listings seek through the path index instead of scanning the full root-filesystem table, preventing extension-readiness fan-out from stalling unrelated WebUI requests.
- *(webui-v2)* expose per-user secret provisioning in Admin user details with write-only values, handle-only listings, and confirmed deletion ([#6118](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/issues/6118)).
- *(webui-v2)* render the Extensions Registry as soon as catalog data arrives instead of holding the skeleton screen for slower installed-extension enrichment ([#6052](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/issues/6052)).
- *(webui-v2)* submit the latest composer value when Enter follows input before React rerenders, avoiding intermittently dropped follow-up messages ([#6044](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/issues/6044)).
- *(reborn)* recover the filesystem resource governor after transient libSQL writer contention without bypassing durable accounting, reject stale authority writes during recovery, and distinguish accounting outages from provider budget failures.
- *(reborn)* `builtin.result_read` input errors now carry structured, model-visible input-error detail (field path, issue code, expected/received) with model-controlled echoes secret-redacted, and truncated previews of top-level JSON-array results report the array's `item_count` — persisted end-to-end through the observation validator ([#6059](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/6059)).
- *(reborn)* ride out transient model-provider outages with cancellation-aware availability retries, fail fast when no provider is configured, and preserve actionable shell/coding failure reasons for the model ([#5959](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/5959)).
- *(slack)* resolve known DM conversation IDs through an exact Slack lookup before encoding mentions, avoiding wrong-target posts when conversation lists are long or display names are ambiguous.
- *(reborn)* add an explicit tenant extension-ownership migration that assigns every installed extension to every existing user, and clean up the departing user's external connection and personal credentials without tearing down the package for remaining users.
- *(reborn)* make extension-scoped OAuth and explicit extension removal restart-safe and fenced: malformed callbacks now terminate durable flows, status reads are observational with an explicit reconciliation command, multi-credential activation waits without revoking completed credentials, Slack cleanup fences ingress before fallible identity deletion, and uninstall cleanup obligations survive catalog/package loss.
- *(reborn)* allow `builtin.time` parse, convert, format, and diff operations to consume JSON numbers or numeric strings containing Unix seconds, integral Unix milliseconds, and fractional Slack timestamps in addition to ISO 8601 strings.

### Changed

- *(reborn-extensions)* every first-party integration (GitHub, Gmail, Google Calendar/Docs/Drive/Sheets/Slides, Notion, Slack, Telegram, Web Access) now ships as a self-contained module under `ironclaw_first_party_extensions::packages`, carrying its manifest/WASM embeds, onboarding copy, OAuth-setup credential, and host trust effects as opaque bundle data. Composition builds them via `bundled_packages()` and the built-in trust policy iterates the inventory generically — generic host code no longer names a concrete extension for package machinery (P7b, DEL-8 lane A).
- *(reborn)* move product-neutral channel delivery into its own crate and make the Telegram host own its concrete state, setup-revision workflow, and trigger-delivery behavior while composition remains mount/registration-only ([#6159](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/6159)).
- *(webui-v2)* serve the Reborn WebUI from root-level browser routes, with temporary `/v2` compatibility redirects that preserve deep links and login query parameters; `/api/webchat/v2/*` remains unchanged ([#6142](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/issues/6142)).
- *(reborn)* raise the default agent-loop runaway backstop from 256 to 1,024 iterations and the subagent ceiling from 16 to 256 ([#5959](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/5959)).
- *(reborn-cli)* document the standalone `config init` atomic-write dependency on `tempfile` and call out the default runner cadence change to 5s heartbeats / 200ms polling (down from 10s / 2s).
- *(reborn)* expose runtime poll settings and document the standalone turn-runner cadence change for callers using `TurnRunnerSettings::default()`.
- *(channels)* v1 Slack DM policy now defaults to `allowlist` (previously `pairing`); existing installs still configured with `dm_policy=pairing` fall through to `allowlist` as Slack relay pairing is retired ([#5604](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/5604)).
- *(reborn-cli)* **Breaking:** `ironclaw serve` now rejects the legacy `[slack]` config fields (`installation_id`, `team_id`, `api_app_id`, `slack_user_id`, `user_id`, `shared_subject_user_id`, `signing_secret_env`, `bot_token_env`, `channel_routes`). Slack bot credentials and routing are configured from the WebUI channel setup page; per-user identity comes only from Slack OAuth. `[slack].enabled` / `IRONCLAW_REBORN_SLACK_ENABLED` still gate whether the channel mounts ([#5604](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/5604)).
- *(reborn-extensions)* the credential-authority type is now `VendorId` end-to-end (renamed from `ProviderId` / `RuntimeCredentialAccountProviderId`); stored vendor id strings are unchanged and the persisted wire field stays `provider`. Extension manifests adopt schema `reborn.extension_manifest.v3` (explicit `[channel]` and `[auth.<vendor>]` sections); the v2 reader still parses and normalizes old manifests into the same resolved model (P1, MAN-11/MAN-2).
- *(reborn)* outbound delivery is unified behind a single host-owned delivery coordinator — the sole delivery-state writer; channel adapters render and send through `ChannelAdapter::deliver` with no store access, and there is no direct product send path (P5, OUT-1/OUT-4).

### CI / Release

- *(release)* publish the canonical Reborn `ironclaw` package from `ironclaw-v*` tags with cargo-dist across seven OS/CPU targets, including archives, checksums, shell and PowerShell installers, and MSI, while excluding legacy v1, WASM, Docker, npm publishing, and the old registry-update/announcement path ([#6160](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/issues/6160)).

### Removed

- *(reborn)* retire the `ProductAdapter` trait and its `ironclaw_wasm_product_adapters` host-runtime crate as a consolidation; the live external-protocol contract is `ChannelAdapter`, onto which ProductAdapter's conformance and outbound-delivery suites were ported unweakened (P7b, DEL-5). The `*_v2` adapter crates were renamed to `*_extension` (DEL-2).
- *(channels)* remove the v1 `pairing_approve` builtin tool and the generic `channel_connection_resume` machinery as part of retiring Slack relay pairing; existing Slack pairing users reconnect via OAuth (Telegram/WASM self-service pairing via the pairing endpoints is unaffected) ([#5604](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/5604)).
- *(reborn-auth)* delete the per-vendor auth machinery — the provider-string multiplexor, `HostOAuthProviderSpec` and the per-vendor provider specs, the per-vendor gate providers/registries, and the Slack/Google serve branches — in favor of one recipe-driven `ironclaw_auth::AuthEngine` (`oauth2_code` + `api_key`). All five current vendors (Slack, Google, Notion, GitHub, NEAR AI) are expressed as manifest recipes with no per-vendor code path in the engine and no auth trait in the extension ABI (P3, AUTH-1/AUTH-16).
