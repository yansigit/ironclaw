//! Category→summary data tables — the user-facing sentence for a failed run.
//!
//! Moved here from `ironclaw_turn_runner::failure_summary` by PROPOSAL §6.1.1
//! ("failure-summary *data* … joins the existing `failure` module so product
//! stops depending on runner"). Everything in this module is a **pure lookup**:
//! `&str` in, `&'static str` out, no host state and no internal dependency.
//!
//! What deliberately stayed with the producer (`ironclaw_turn_runner`), because
//! it is typed on loop vocabulary this crate must never depend on:
//!
//! - `checkpoint_rejection_host_explanation`, the *writer* half of the
//!   checkpoint-rejection envelope (it takes an `agent_loop` `CheckpointKind`
//!   and a `loop_contracts` `LoopSafeSummary`), and its `checkpoint_stage_name`
//!   stage renderer;
//! - every classifier that decides *which* category applies.
//!
//! The envelope constants below are therefore the single shared definition the
//! split writer and reader both key off. The writer's round-trip test
//! (`checkpoint_rejection_explanation_round_trips_every_stage`) exercises this
//! module across the crate boundary for all four checkpoint stages, so the two
//! halves cannot drift apart silently.
