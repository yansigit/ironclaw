//! Scope-routing gateway for Reborn group integration tests: routes model calls to
//! per-thread scripted gateways by `TurnScope` via `resolve_for_scope`, called at
//! host-construction time (off the model hot path). Its own `stream_model` is
//! unreachable on success — fails loudly with `ConfigurationError` on an unregistered
//! scope, preserving the single-fake-at-vendor-SDK-seam invariant (CLAUDE.md §5-8, §28):
//! the only fake is the `TraceLlm` at the bottom of each registered gateway's chain.

// Shared by all group test binaries; symbols read as dead when a binary
